<p><span class="lead-text"><b>APPENDIX “A”: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST DISCLOSURE</b></span></p>
<p>There will be situations where a conflict will arise between the interests of ScotiaMcLeod and/or its advisors and your interest. These conflicts may be actual conflicts of interest or you may perceive that ScotiaMcLeod or its advisors have a conflict of interest. Conflicts can give rise to a concern that ScotiaMcLeod or its advisors may act or will act with a view to their own business or personal interest. Conflicts can&nbsp;also arise in circumstances where there are differing interests amongst clients, which may lead to a perception that ScotiaMcLeod will be favouring a client or set of clients over other clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canadian securities laws require ScotiaMcLeod to take reasonable steps to identify and respond to material conflicts of interest in your best interest and tell you about them, including how the conflicts might impact you and how ScotiaMcLeod addresses them in your best interest.</p>
<p>We seek to avoid or minimize conflicts where reasonably possible. We seek to avoid actual or perceived favouritism or discrimination amongst clients and to ensure that no client receives preferential treatment over another in the operation and management of their account and execution of trades. Some conflicts cannot be avoided, including those conflicts that are inherent in our relationship with Scotiabank and with our affiliates arising out&nbsp;<span>of our membership in the Scotiabank group of companies. It is important that you are fully informed regarding our conflicts, including how we address them in your best interests.</span></p>
<p>This Conflicts of Interest Disclosure (<b>Conflicts Statement</b>) sets out important information regarding our material conflicts of interest. These are described in this Conflicts Statement, along with the potential impact on and risk that the conflict could pose to&nbsp;you and how we address the conflict to minimize its impact and risks to you and our other clients.&nbsp;<span>In situations that we do not or cannot avoid a conflict of interest, where our interests may compete with yours, we will always give your interests priority&nbsp;over ours, which allows you to be confident that we address conflicts in your best interest. Generally speaking, we deal with and manage conflicts as follows:</span></p>
<p>&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We avoid conflicts which are prohibited by law, as well as conflicts that we cannot effectively control in your best interest.</p>
<p>&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our advisors are required to comply with various policies and procedures, which are designed&nbsp;<span>to ensure that our advisors follow ethical and client-first business practices. These policies and&nbsp;procedures include the Scotiabank Code of Conduct.</span></p>
<p>&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We control or manage acceptable conflicts by physically separating different business functions and restricting the internal exchange of information.</p>
<p>&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our internal compensation practices are designed to ensure that advisors are not incented or influenced to make investments in your account in specific issuers or financial products.</p>
<p>&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For each material conflict, we seek to resolve it in your best interest.</p>
<p>&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We disclose information about conflicts material to you so that you can assess independently if these conflicts are significant to you.</p>
<p><span class="lead-text"><b>Material Conflicts Arising from Being a Member of the Scotiabank Group of Companies:</b></span></p>
<p>ScotiaMcLeod is a division of Scotia Capital Inc. Scotia Capital Inc. is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Bank of Nova Scotia (<b>Scotiabank</b>). Our relationship to Scotiabank and its other financial services subsidiaries (the <b>Scotiabank group of companies</b>) creates conflicts of interest when we provide products and services&nbsp;<span>to you that are sourced from or provided by other members of the Scotiabank group of companies.</span></p>
<p>Scotiabank and its various financial services subsidiaries, including ScotiaMcLeod, are commercial businesses and seek to maximize profits while providing fair, honest and appropriate services to clients. This means we may encourage you to do more business with us and the other members of the Scotiabank group of companies, and we may engage our affiliates to provide us with products and services for your account, but will always do so in a way that we consider in your best interests. We will only enter into these transactions&nbsp;or arrangements where they are permitted under applicable securities laws and where we believe they are in your best interests.</p>
<p>Although Scotia Capital Inc. is under common ownership with the other members of the Scotiabank group of companies and may from time to time have directors and officers in common with these other firms, Scotia Capital Inc. is a separate and distinct corporate entity.&nbsp;ScotiaMcLeod generally carries on its activities independent of the other firms owned by Scotiabank. However, from time to time there may be certain cooperative business arrangements between it&nbsp;<span>and the other firms, such as arrangements relating to introduction of clients, distribution of products, advisory relationships or administrative support.</span></p>
<p>In addition to applicable regulatory provisions and contractual provisions respecting any business arrangements that may exist between ScotiaMcLeod and the other Scotiabank group of companies, the directors, officers and employees of each of the&nbsp;<span>firms are subject to Guidelines or Codes of Conduct governing their actions. These Guidelines are supplemented by our internal compliance policies and procedures.</span></p>
<p>In all cases, the conflicts described in this section raise perceptions that we will favour the business interests of the various members of the Scotiabank group of companies, when the products and services we provide you that are sourced from or provided&nbsp;<span>by those members may not be in your best interests. These conflicts and how we manage them to ensure that we act in your best interests are described below.</span></p>
<p><span class="lead-text"><b>We would like you to use more services offered by members of the Scotiabank group of companies and buy more of the products offered by other members of the Scotiabank group of companies.</b></span></p>
<p>&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Referral arrangements are disclosed and operated in accordance with regulatory standards.</p>
<p>&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have policies and procedures prohibiting recommendations solely for the purpose of generating revenue for us without any benefit to you.</p>
<p><span class="lead-text"><b>In the course of our relationship with you, we may trade in or give advice on securities of “related” and “connected” issuers. We may:</b></span></p>
<p>&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make recommendations regarding these securities to you.</p>
<p>&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sell investment fund securities issued and managed by affiliates of ScotiaMcLeod.</p>
<p>&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exercise discretionary authority to buy or sell these securities for your account.</p>
<p>&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We manage this conflict in your best interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are required by regulation to disclose this when we make a recommendation to you.</li>
<li>We inform you whether a transaction involved a related or connected security on the trade confirmation and account statement.</li>
<li>Our advisors receive the same commission compensation payout as a percentage of gross revenue regardless of the product originator.</li>
<li>We make such recommendations based on our assessment of suitability of the investment for you.</li>
<li>We conduct due diligence on such securities in the same ways as we do for other unrelated securities issuers.</li>
<li>All of our related parties are disclosed in the Scotia Capital Inc. Statement of Policies, which is available on our website and updated from time to time to disclose a full listing of our “related” and “connected” issuers.</li>
<li>If you have an advisory account with us, you consent to the purchase or sale of securities issued by our “related” and “connected” issuers.

</ul>
<p><span class="lead-text"><b>We may receive commissions or other forms of compensation (new issue commission) when securities are offered for sale for the first time in the primary market and/or through a secondary&nbsp;offering (new issue) and the securities are distributed by ScotiaMcLeod or one of its affiliates as a member of the underwriting or selling group.</b></span></p>
<p>The new issue commission is paid by the security issuer and/or selling security holder to ScotiaMcLeod, our affiliate(s) and/or their respective advisors, as applicable, and this is in addition to any commission and/or any other fees and charges you pay us in respect of our trading or advising on such securities for your accounts (<b>account fees</b>).</p>

<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transferring-in to your managed account(s); and</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exercising its discretionary authority to hold in your managed account(s);&nbsp;securities previously purchased by you on a new issue, notwithstanding that ScotiaMcLeod or any of its affiliates may&nbsp;<span>have acted as a member of the underwriting or selling group for the new issue and received new issue commission from the security issuer and/or selling security holder in respect of the new issue and this is in addition to any commission and/or other fees and charges you pay us in respect of our trading or advising on such securities for your accounts.</span></p>

We maintain information barriers between our corporate trading activities and retail advisory business.</p>
<p><span class="lead-text"><b>We may sell you securities which we own (called principal trades) and profit by doing so.</b></span></p>
<p>We will tell you whether we acted as principal or agent for each transaction on the trade confirmation.</p>
<p>In the case of fixed income securities, which we always sell as principal, we provide you with a stated yield to maturity so you can assess the competitiveness of our pricing.</p>
<p><span class="lead-text"><b>We engage in trading of securities for our own account (called proprietary trading).</b></span></p>
<p>We maintain information barriers between our corporate trading activities and retail advisory business.</p>
<p>Firm and employee trades are identified as such and client trades are given priority to firm and employee trades in accordance with industry “client priority” regulations.</p>
<p><span class="lead-text"><b>We and our affiliates may earn revenue from other sources derived from our management and operation of your account.</b></span></p>
<p>All such business conducted by ScotiaMcLeod and our affiliates is on market terms and conditions and we monitor such business on a periodic basis to determine whether it and our applicable affiliates provide appropriate service to us and our clients in ways they would do if the affiliates were not related to us.</p>
<p><span class="lead-text"><b>Referral arrangements may exist from time to time within the Scotiabank group of companies, including ScotiaMcLeod.
